# # eHealth CouchDB Users Importer

- [Export users from CouchDB](#exporting)
- [Import users into CouchDB](#importing)

## Setup

git clone git@github.com:eHealthAfrica/couchdb-users-bulk-import.git
cd couchdb-users


### Exporting

#### json exporting

TODO

#### csv exporting

The csv exporting functionality is provided by a `list` function
running against a view function. In order to operate on the remote
host conveniently, we suggest you to set some environment variables:

```
$  admin_password=verysecret # prefixing with a space will skip it in history
$ host="https://admin:$admin_password@dev-gn-call-center.eocng.org/_couchdb/" # for example
```

After setting these, you can use the following commands
verbatim. Exporting can be done by pushing the view if it is not on
the database already, and then getting the results.

- push the couchdb exporter design documents to the `_users` database.
In order to make this step easier, using [couchapp](https://github.com/eHealthAfrica/tools-reference/blob/master/couchapp.md) is recommended.

```
cd csv_exporter
couchapp push "$host/_users"
```

- get the results. It is necessary to request `include_docs=true` as well as to pass as parameters the fields we want.
see [fields parameter documentation in the code](./csv_exporter/lists/csv.js#3-8L)

```
curl "$host/_users/_design/csv/_list/csv/users/?include_docs=true&fields=_id~ID|details.fullName~Name|roles~Role(s)|details.fullName~Details.fullName|details.info~Details.info"
```
